## Overview

This is a simple car price prediction Flask app trained on Random Forest Regrresor. The trained model  takes seven features describing a car (year, showroom price, driven Kilometers,number of owners the car has previously had, fuel type, seller type and transmission type) as an input and predict the price of the car.

## Technical Aspect
+ This project is divided into two part:
  + 1.Training a deep learning model using Random Forest Regrresor.
  + 2.Building and hosting a Flask web app on Heroku.
